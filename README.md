## Project Overview  

The **Green-Coin Management System** is a structured relational database developed to streamline the management of carbon credits under a cap-and-trade policy. It allows **governments to monitor emissions**, **companies to report and trade credits**, and **NGOs/citizens to access data**, fostering a transparent and sustainable environmental ecosystem.

---

## Functional Highlights  

- **Emission Monitoring:** Track greenhouse gas emissions by company and type.  
- **Credit & Penalty Automation:** Allocate credits, calculate penalties, and reward eco-compliance.  
- **Policy Enforcement:** Implement government regulations and conditions dynamically.  
- **Transaction Logging:** Record carbon credit trades between organizations.  
- **Stakeholder Integration:** Support for company branches, POCs, regulators, NGOs, and public access.
