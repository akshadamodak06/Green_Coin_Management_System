<u>Objective:</u>

Carbon emission rights, also known as carbon credits, are part of a cap-and-trade system that regulates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Governments or regulatory bodies set a limit (cap) on the total emissions allowed, and companies receive emission allowances based on their expected emissions. If a company emits less than its allocated quota, it can trade (sell) the excess credits to other companies that exceed their limits. This creates a financial incentive for companies to reduce emissions and adopt cleaner technologies.

The proposed database system will track and manage Carbon Credits, monitor company emissions, calculate carbon tax, allocate credits, and enable structured trading of surplus credits.
